  review: "Bought this and a matching one for my fiancée for a mountain climb. It performed well in misty, steady rain initially but was thoroughly soaked through for both of us by the end. Definitely not something you’d want to trust in a torrential downpour but probably a good jacket for walking around in the city. I love though, REI and look forward to seeing what they release/tweak next.",

  review: "I’ve been looking for a trustworthy rain jacket that I don’t have to mortgage my house for. When I saw this jacket online, I thought it might fit the bill, so I decided to pop into an REI to check it out. While it’s missing some of the bells and whistles of pricier options, like “pit zips”, that’s kind of the point. It’s waterproof, windproof, and made of a seemingly durable material, with minimal branding, all for $50. I wore it out of the store and into a driving rain to walk back to my car, and stayed dry all the way. The next day, a stiff wind didn’t affect me at all. The jacket does run large; I typically wear XL in most clothing, including REI’s products, but I had room to layer a puffy underneath even when sizing down to a large. Size down accordingly.",

I used it around town and on several short 1 to 4 day backpacking trips and it seemed to work fine, although it didn't really get put to the test. However, on a recent 9 day trip to West Virginia, I encountered rainy conditions several days. I found that under backpacking conditions, the fabric seemed to wet out pretty readily and I had wet arms and shoulders. In short, this jacket may be fine where rain is light and rare, but not in spring in the Alleghenies or the northwest.",

  review: "Used during a 3-day field sniper match. All gear for three days including rifle and ammo needed to be carried to each stage, with camping at night. Lightweight gear a must. Purchased the Helium jacket and pants with this in mind, but also hoped for a dry weekend. Well, heavy rains for the first 24 hours of the competition. Jacket material repelled rain well and protected clothing underneath, but did wet out within a couple of hours. On the upside when the sun did finally show the lightweight material dried extremely fast. Wore the pants the entire match to shrug off mud when rucking and crawling at stages, the lightweight material held up fine.",

  review: "This is my ultra-light quiver shell. I take this everywhere all year long. It compresses to an incredibly small size, so its in my bag where ever I go for rain or snow. In the winter, Ill toss it over my OR Transcendent puffy to keep warm and dry on the street, on belay, or on a speedy ascent on a weekend crag. In the Spring and summer, its the perfect weight to keep dry without sweating your clothes out. Ill keep it in my climbing or light hiking pack, and will throw it on mid-route when an unexpected rain comes through. Pairs exceptionally well with the OR Ferrosi hoody for Spring and Fall climbing when a blast of wet cold can shoot in on you. It looks great, so it goes with me on the town or to Seattle sports events where rain is a constant factor. It has no frills and or basic features, but that's the whole point of a bomber, ultra-light rain jacket.",

I wore my rain coat over it several times to block the wind.  I used the jacket in 10 deg temps in the Smokey's and I stayed warm.  I abused the jacket about every way possible and it's still in good shape.  It got drug over rocks, thru trees and brush.  It got rained on and it didn't always get washed per the instructions.  There's not any rips or tears and while it doesn't look like a new jacket any more, I can't justify replacing it either.",

  review: "These are great jackets but I have found that they wear out if not treated carefully. I'm on my third one, and I use it primarily for warmth in camp, when taking breaks hiking, etc. With the previous two, I made the mistake of treating them as jackets for everyday wear; over time, the quilting stitches started to go on both (cosmetic problem only, at least initially), and the zipper wore out on one. I tend to be hard on clothing, and I think making any jacket light and packable involves some compromises on durability. But this fits me better than any of the others that REI stocks (it's not super-slim, and neither am I) and it;s still a great jacket.",

My only complaint and concern is that for the price, I’ve had to return one already because the thread was pulling out and for a $200 dollar jacket that’s not something you expect, especially when I only wear it around town. I haven’t hiked or put this jacket through the ringer at all. I returned the first one and exchanged it for another one come to find out I found another thread pulling out. I’m torn because of the price of this jacket. I’m debating just returning it altogether and going with a different brand.",

  review: "So many minimalist bloggers and vloggers give this jacket such high praise. I don’t recall ever hearing a bad word about it. So, I decided to give it a try. It’s wonderful at keeping you warm, especially when layered. I work outdoors year-round, and have worn this jacket (with some extra layers) almost everyday this winter. No complaints there. My only complaint is that the shell material is so thin that it rips so easily, ending up with little tufts of white polyester poking out. Lightly brushing a broken twig put a hole in my arm. A dog jumping up to put its front paws on my waist led to a couple more. Etc. I would expect a bit better quality for the price. If the material was a little tougher it would be perfect.",

While very thin and almost weightless, the jacket seems to have the ability to adapt to the temperature around you and make you forget you are wearing it.  Perfect for wearing under waders in cool to cold climates.  While in Alaska, noticed that 75%+ of the fishing guides have one (the hoodie version for fast boating). Liked it so much that I bought vest too. Both compress down to almost nothing for easy packing.",

I only had on a t-shirt under and I was plenty warm. So at 40 degrees I didn’t even have to layer up and then shed as we hit 50/55.

Thankfully there’s a Patagonia store in Pittsburgh and they were really helpful with showing me NOT TO PULL feathers out, but pushing them back in. Pulling them out only makes the hole larger and brings more feathers out.",

  review: "Excellent as a stand alone winter coat. Keeps the cold off me and allows plenty of movement for all sorts of outdoor activities including the evening dog-walk in the cold night air. It also is a perfect layer for a parka in the rain. Skip the 3-in-1 and use the Silent Down Jacket and your favorite parka as separates. It has the usual solid Patagonia construction while being light weigh and stylish which is not always easy to find today.",

  review: "I bought this awesome puffy at REI in San Antonio. Yes I know, San Antonio is a warm climate but I live in Arkansas.  I have already put the puffy to use in mild temperatures (27 degrees) and it was very comfortable.  Other who had similar coats in another brand were COLD, hehe!  The coat is very quiet and I normally wear a XL and I bought the XL and it has plenty of room to layer if so desired.  I give this Patagonia puffy two thumbs up.",

  review: `Purchased this jacket hoping it would be a contender to add to the "go to jacket pile" i have in my closet for cold days. Normally I run an Arc'teryx Atom LT Hoody, or an OR Ferrosi Hoody. This is in the similar price point and was hoping for a winner. Sadly, the zippers and seams around them are poorly put together, and the main front zipper is difficult to negotiate and zip up because the insert pin doesn't slip well into the zipper retaining box easily at all. In terms of feel on the skin, the outside and the inside of the jacket are lined with identical material, making the inside of the sleeves feel rough. Normally I might expect a microfiber fleece lining on parts of the inside of the jacket, or maybe just the pockets. No luck here. The fit is nice, not too slim, not too puffy, but the other negatives along with the current price don't justify the purchase. Will be returning.`,

  review: `This jacket is sized longer than usual, much larger than usual in the stomach, and MUCH smaller than usual in the shoulders/arms. I ordered a medium, and the stomach is probably big enough to fit someone with a 40+" waist, and it's long enough to fit someone 6'6". However, the shoulders and arms are EXTREMELY tight. I assumed that a brand named "Craghoppers" would have a fairly athletic fit, but it's the exact opposite, this is sized for someone tall, wide in the stomach, and scrawny in the arms/shoulders.`,

  review: `I had been looking for a decent puffy for the colder months for a bit now, but not wanting to break the bank. Then I came across the Craghoppers down jacket on clearance at my local REI. The only one in store was a medium and I typically wear a large (I'm about 5'10 and 170 with a medium/athletic build for reference), but tried on the medium anyways. Overall the jacket fits great, definitely fits more like a large than a medium. I can still wear layers under it when needed, and to wear a layer over it (like a rain jacket) isn't bad either. My first time wearing it out in inclement weather (temps in the teens and strong winds) I was shocked how well it blocked the wind, and it's very warm, especially for not being very bulky.`,

I felt like the jacket was snug in the chest, comfortable in the arms and snug on the waist. It was also big in the abdomen. I originally ordered the small which might have been a mistake on my part. The zipper was European and also would snag on the inside constantly. Eventually traded this in for the Rei brand which fit excellent.`,

  It's more comfortable than the other jackets I tried out at REI at this price point. The Arcteryx and Patagonia parkas were the only ones that were as comfortable, but they're the in $400-500 price range.
  The only downside is that you can tell they cut corners on the seams like velcro and zippers. They're cheaper but they'll still do the job. For the price, this is a good jacket`,

I was a little concerned about fit when I ordered it, since sometimes Patagonia is a little unpredictable, bit it's very much true to size. I've walked the dog on a morning in the low 20s, and I've walked back and forth to work in the upper 40s-lower50s, and found it to be exactly the right amount of insulation in all of those settings.  I stayed dry even in some moderate rain/snow mix.  The hood fits great, even without any way to adjust it around the face (has a pull in the back).  Highly recommend.`,

  review: `I love this jacket. It's high quality, ethical down, which makes for a lightweight and seriously warm jacket. It's great around 30F with just a t-shirt underneath. With a thin fleece jacket underneath I can go much lower - I recently wore it in single digit temps with negative windchill and was fine. And it looks great.`,

  review: `When looking for a down jacket I had researched and tried on so many that it was really overwhelming. Ultimately, I choose this down jacket for the following reasons: First, the fit and quality of the jacket is superb. Second, I've been wearing the jacket for about a week and have not noticed any down leaking from the seams. Third, several other jackets I tried on were very uncomfortable when fully zipped. This jacket has a soft velour to cover the zipper so it does not dig into the chin. Fourth, Patagonia has an amazing warranty on their products.`,

This thing was too tight, and I'm not sure if Patagonia is simply trying to skimp on cost.  But as expensive as their jackets are, this thing should fit perfectly.`,

  review: `I've had my nano puff for over 5 years and with constant, year round use it's showing its age so I'm replacing it with the same jacket.  The jacket is a perfect weight for running around the city in all seasons.  In Minnesota's early season winter it's great to have a less bulky jacket option.  I have brought it camping often and if it's cool (40 degrees or less) I'm not warm enough when not active so I've layered a micro fleece jacket under it.`,

  review: `I was so excited about this jacket. I wanted something that I could use for a North Carolina winter and figured this would be perfect since I could layer under it on the few days it gets really cold. After only a few days the threads on both arms started to come loose and I can feel them getting caught on the zipper and pulling them out even more. They also get snagged on brick walls and doorways so I feel like I'm always having to be super careful where my arms are at all times. I'm in between sizes so it zips up really uncomfortably. I tried a size up at the store and it was like a tent on me. Not fault of Patagonia, just my large hips.`,

  review: `Been eyeing this jacket for years and finally bought one. I'm 5'7", 125-ish and could've gone with the small or medium. The medium was a looser fit but not horribly so. I went with the small because I figure most of my layering will be over this jacket, not under it. While the small is more fitted, I actually can wear a retro-x vest under it, which surprised me. So it's roomier than it seems. Wore it over a light hoodie for a snowy hike in 27 degrees this morning and I was perfectly comfortable. I got the gray color and it has a subtle sheen to it that I like. The jacket looks great with jeans or leggings. I'm seeing serious usage for this jacket going forward!`,

  review: `As a preface I can be a little picky about my clothes but when you invest the money in a product you want it to be everything you paid for. I really loved this jacket but unfortunately after only a few wears I noticed the stitching coming out here and there. I bought this jacket initially, noticed stitching issues, exchanged it for another one, and noticed the same thing on this second jacket. A huge bummer but nonetheless I will be returning it to REI and getting myself a nice little something in place of this jacket. This wouldn't stop me from buying Patagonia products in the future but because of the many stitching issues that could arise from it I would steer clear of this one.`,

  review: `This jacket was intended for the PNW, however, a business trip to Toronto came up last week, so I decided to give this jacket a whirl. So glad I did! Temperatures were on average -6 and in certain areas west of Toronto were -15.  This jacket was a lifesaver. I wore it as an additional layer under my coat. It's warm and thin enough where you don't feel like a bulky snowman walking around. Love the fact that it has a high collar and a lining at the end of the zipper so it doesn't scratch your chin or neck. The 2 zip pockets and the hidden one inside are awesome. All pockets were able to fit by S7 nicely. Based on the test run in Toronto, I'm sure this jacket will hold up in Seattle. Highly recommend.`,

  review: `I was on the hunt for a lighter synthetic down jacket that would keep me warm in windy San Francisco and that would also be practical for outdoor adventures. After pretty extensive research, I decided on the Nano Puff, and I'm so glad I did. This jacket is light weight but also does a great job protecting against the SF wind. I ordered a small (5'6", 125 lbs, and a larger chest), which is perfect. I can layer a thin, hooded vest underneath to add additional warmth if needed. I could've gone with a medium if I wanted more room. The small isn't too tight and doesn't restrict my movement during outdoor activities.`,

  review: `Excellent when new -- lightweight and quite warm.  However, over time, a few threads unraveled, the fabric pilled in high wear areas, and worst of all, it lost it a good deal of insulating ability.  Followed washing & drying instructions, but warmth didn't really improve.  Contacted Patagonia Customer Service and was told to expect decrease in performance for a jacket of this age, and there was nothing they could suggest to restore performance.  Great while it lasted, but not sure we got our money's worth.  Am now trying the Arc'teryx Atom LT jacket as it's on Winter Sale.`,

The back comes down low enough that if you bend over it does not have the peek a boo between your jeans and jacket. Not puffy at all and looks great with work clothes and jeans!`,

We didn’t ski the first day, waited for day two when the temp was getting closer to zero.  What a warm jacket!! No issues skiing in sub zero to low teens. One long sleeve quick dry base layer, a pullover, and the ski jacket.  Never got cold at all! And when the temps heated up to near freezing I didn’t get over heated either. What a great design!`,

Warmer than its light weight makes it seem and has swallowed up any layers I've tried underneath it, very comfortably. The 5 pockets are well-designed and the hand pockets are comfortable and easy to put things in. The hood is big and very adjustable. Grippy snowskirt and cinchable around the hips. Great activewear. I look forward to trying it for downhill and x-country skiing. It's been great so far around town and for cold weather hiking in New England.`,

Fit is on the large side, I wear between a med and large, got the medium and there’s plenty of room without being too big. Got the graphite, matches my Thule camera backpack (with the blue accents) nicely I’ll not be home bound this winter. Very pleased, if you like it check it out.. very cool!`,

  review: `I was looking for a versatile jacket for snow, rain, and casual wear and dislike the 3-1 jackets that are all the rage right now. Found this jacket, last of its model at my local REI in my size nonetheless, tried it on, and was immediately sold. The jacket keeps you warm without feeling like a sauna (one of my favorite qualities of this jacket since I tend to run warm) while eliminating excess bulkiness. The thermal reflective lining serves its purpose and is well placed along the inside of the jacket to maintain your core temp. Another great quality of this jacket is that it has plenty of pockets - fleece lined pockets for your hands, chest pocket, (secret) inner lining pocket, and an extra pocket for snow goggles, or anything else. Also, the outer Omni-Tech material is structured, which is great, without being stiff or inhibiting mobility. I usually purchase TNF products, but this one's definitely a winner.`,

  review: `I got this last minute for a trip to northern montana to replace a lighter montbell "puffy" that didnt have the ruggedness this does.  Had consistent temps from single digits to 20s daily for weeks in the mountains, also with snow and being exposee for days in high winds. I never had to break out my hard shell one single time.  This is both water and wind proof and was not compromised. Nice rugged materials, super warm and worth the money.`,

  title: "Great all around coat",
  stars: 5,
  review: `I purchased this because I wanted a lightweight coat that looks nice and, most importantly, didn't make me feel like I was in a cocoon.  It is really warm with proper under layer, especially if you are moving around.  It might not be the best for standing around in below freezing weather, but that is not what it is designed for.  I really like that I can sit in my car with it on and feel like I have total freedom of movement.  I wore it in the rain for the first time the other day and it was perfectly waterproof.  Overall, I am very happy with the coat.`,

  review: `Happy with field jacket style, quality double stitching, slim cut, articulating arm design. While I would prefer an additional interior pocket, four outside pockets, with hidden hand warmer serve the job. Great for vest layering. I expect much use, as other kuhl products. Worth a look.`,

  review: `I really like this coat. The fit is slim, but with enough room to wear a warm sweater or nano-puff style coat/vest underneath. The coat is perfect for travel (just returned from several weeks in Europe), with several secure pockets for wallet, passports, phone, etc. The seams on the hood and shoulders leaked a little in heavy rain, but 5 minutes with some canvas wax (Fjalraven) fixed that issue.`,

  title: "My new favorite jacket",
  stars: 5,
  review: `This is my first KUHL product, and frankly my first jacket purchase in the PNW. I have had this jacket going on two years, and love this item. It is perfect for windy days and overcast weather. The hem and joint stitching is extremely durable. There is plenty of room for movement, but this jacket tends to fit slim. Does a good job of wicking away rain and moisture alike. The hood brim is just a little too short on my head, so I wear a billed hat when it drizzles. I would recommend touching up the wax protective coating once every three months. I will be buying more KUHL products in the future for sure.`,

  stars: 2,
  review: `Great looking light jacket, hated the collar. Stiff and bulky around my neck, folding it down made it even stiffer. I didn't wear it other than trying it on, but I think a day of walking would have rubbed my neck raw. Repacking the hood as flat as possible didn't help. (5'10, 180# 17" neck, wide shoulders) Wish they made the hood removable, this probably would have solved the problem. Kuhl seems to run narrow in the shoulders, so consider ordering up a size if you are broad-shouldered or want to layer.`,

  title: "Nice. A little narrow. And thankfully no Velcro!",
  stars: 4,
  review: `Nice jacket. More of a shell or outer shirt than a jacket - material is thinner and lighter than expected, no lining. Not able to notice the wax coating. Cut slim. Smaller than expected from Kuhl sizes given. If you buy one, don't plan to carry much in the pockets: they are flat, tight, and not built to expand. And the zippered hand-warmer pockets have no cant to them: I wouldn't trust anything carried in them to stay in them unless zipped. Chest pockets are big enough for a Galaxy S4 in a case, but nothing longer. Your wallet and your phone will use up the two chest pockets. An inside wallet pocket would have been really nice.The pockets are the real weak point of this shell: my plain ring with just my car, house, office, and bike keys on it seems outright bulky in one of the lower pockets. Good quality hardware. So glad to find something without Velcro! The Teak color fabric has a nice sheen to it too; we'll see if that holds up or is just for being brand new. Can't speak to water repellency yet, but it is sure to be tested soon.`,
